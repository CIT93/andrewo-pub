I would break this calculation up into two separate fields.
"Examine your dishwasher usage"
---Please select---
option 1 - run dishwasher > 9 times per week (3)
option 2 - run dishwasher 4-9 times per week (2)
option 3 - run dishwasher 1-3 times per week (1)
option 4 - I do not have a dishwasher (0)

"Examine your washing machine usage"
---Please select---
option 1 - run washing machine > 9 times per week (3)
option 2 - run washing machine 4-9 times per week (2)
option 3 - run washing machine 1-3 times per week (1)
option 4 - I do not have a washing machine (0)



I do not know if this is possible (I'm sure it is, because javascript is awesome!), but I would create one form title:
"Examine your water consumption"
and then have two fields of selections side-by-side.
