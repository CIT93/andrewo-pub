The review on functions helped me understand it a little more. Especially when we named the passing argument "arg" and the receiving part "parm". I think also keeping the blockscope to the minimum was beneficial for understanding what was being passed and returned.
Two brand new terms: rest operator and IIFE. I learned that the three dots help with receiving multiple inputs into an array. IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression, which is exactly that, lol. It helps me remember these are extremely small scoped functions, and I think used to keep variables and functions private?
